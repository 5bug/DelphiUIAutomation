# DelphiUIAutomation

DelphiUIAutomation is a framework for automating rich client applications based on Win32 (and specifically tested with Delphi XE5). It is written in Delphi XE5 and it requires no use of scripting languages.

Tests/automation programs using DelphiUIAutomation can be written with Delphi and used in any testing framework.

It provides a consistent object-oriented API, hiding the complexity of Microsoft's UIAutomation library and windows messages.
